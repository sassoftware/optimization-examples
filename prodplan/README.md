# SAS Optimization Examples - Mathematical Programming Examples

## Overview

This folder contains the examples for production planning problems.

uls.sas: Standard model for uncapacitated lot-sizing.
uls_ext.sas: Extended formulation for uncapacitated lot-sizing.
uls_shortest.sas: Shortest path formulation for uncapacitated lot-sizing;
twostage.sas: A somewhat realistic two-stage multi-product multi-machine production planning problem with changeovers.
twostage_ext.sas: Same problem as twostage.sas but using an extended formulation for the second stage.
twostage_box.sas: Same problem as twostage.sas but with a different objective. Instead of minimizing total storage, minimize the maximum number of storage boxes.
