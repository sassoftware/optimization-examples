## TRAVELING BASEBALL FAN PROBLEM
In the traveling salesman problem, a salesman must minimize travel distance while 
visiting each of a given set of cities exactly once. This repository shares three optimization
models that uses the OPTMODEL procedure to formulate and solve the traveling baseball fan problem, which complicates the traveling salesman problem by incorporating scheduling constraints: a baseball fan 
must visit each of the Major League ballparks exactly once, and each visit must 
include watching a scheduled Major League game.
